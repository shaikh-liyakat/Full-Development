//There are to ways to initialize The React App

//First is Raw way by 
npx create-react-app folder_name

Ex npx create-react-app my_react_app


//second is with vite or with different bundlers

npm create vite@latest
cd my-project-folder

npm install
npm run dev


//        What is different 
By raw method it is became heavy and takes times to setup all 
with vite 
it install or setup only required modules only
